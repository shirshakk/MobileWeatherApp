shirshakk: how to login in github through terminal

GitHub Copilot: To log in to GitHub through the terminal, you can use the `gh` CLI (GitHub CLI). Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Install GitHub CLI**:
   If you haven't installed the GitHub CLI, you can download and install it from [GitHub CLI releases](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases).

   Alternatively, you can install it using a package manager. For example, on Windows, you can use `winget`:
   ```sh
   winget install --id GitHub.cli
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**:
   Once the GitHub CLI is installed, you can log in by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   The CLI will guide you through the authentication process. You will be asked to choose a preferred authentication method (e.g., web browser, SSH, or GitHub token).

4. **Verify login**:
   After completing the authentication process, you can verify that you are logged in by running:
   ```sh
   gh auth status
   ```

This will show your current authentication status and the account you are logged in with.

error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shirshakk/MobileWeatherApp.git'

GitHub Copilot: The error message `failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shirshakk/MobileWeatherApp.git'` typically occurs when your local branch is behind the remote branch. To resolve this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Merge the changes into your local branch**:
   ```sh
   git merge origin/main
   ```
   If your branch is named something other than `main`, replace `main` with the correct branch name.

3. **Resolve any merge conflicts** if they arise. Open the conflicted files, make the necessary changes, and then add the resolved files:
   ```sh
   git add <file_name>
   ```

4. **Commit the merge** if necessary:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```

5. **Push your changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
   Again, replace `main` with your branch name if it's different.

If you want to avoid merging and prefer to rebase your changes, you can use the following commands instead:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Rebase your local branch onto the remote branch**:
   ```sh
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. **Resolve any rebase conflicts** if they arise. Open the conflicted files, make the necessary changes, and then add the resolved files:
   ```sh
   git add <file_name>
   ```

4. **Continue the rebase**:
   ```sh
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. **Push your changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

Using rebase can result in a cleaner project history, but it can be more complex to resolve conflicts. Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

Workspace: Collecting workspace information# Weather App Documentation

## Overview
The Weather App is a Flutter application that fetches and displays the current weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeather API.

## Project Structure
```
.gitignore
.idea/
.metadata
analysis_options.yaml
android/
lib/
pubspec.lock
pubspec.yaml
README.md
test/
weather_app.iml
```

### Key Files and Directories
- **lib/main.dart**: The main entry point of the application.
- **lib/consts.dart**: Contains constants used in the application.
- **android/**: Contains Android-specific configuration and code.
- **test/**: Contains test files for the application.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Defines the dependencies and metadata for the project.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:
- `flutter`: The Flutter SDK.
- `cupertino_icons`: Cupertino icons for iOS.
- `weather`: A package to fetch weather data.
- `intl`: A package for internationalization and localization.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd weather_app
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Main Components
### main.dart
- **MyApp**: The root widget of the application.
- **HomePage**: The main screen displaying weather information.
- **_HomePageState**: The state class for `HomePage` that fetches and displays weather data.

### consts.dart
- **OPENWEATHER_API_KEY**: The API key for accessing the OpenWeather API.

## Weather Data Fetching
The weather data is fetched using the `WeatherFactory` class from the `weather` package. The API key is stored in consts.dart.

### Example:
```dart
final WeatherFactory _wf = WeatherFactory(OPENWEATHER_API_KEY);
_wf.currentWeatherByCityName("Delhi").then((w) {
  setState(() {
    _weather = w;
  });
});
```
